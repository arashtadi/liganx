"""AI-assisted compound editing.

Wraps the Anthropic Messages API with a chemistry-focused system prompt
so the rest of the app can ask "given this SMILES, do X" in plain
language and get back a modified SMILES + a one-line rationale. We
deliberately use plain httpx (not the official anthropic SDK) so the
backend's dependency footprint stays small — one HTTP call to one
endpoint isn't worth a transitive dependency tree.

Model: claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 (fast + cheap, ~$1/1M input tokens).
For chemistry-grade reasoning we may upgrade to Sonnet later, but
Haiku handles "swap COOH for tetrazole" / "add a methyl at para"
style edits well in our internal tests.

Output contract: the model is asked to return strict JSON. We parse
defensively (regex fallback for the common case where the model wraps
the JSON in a code fence) and validate the new SMILES with RDKit
before shipping it back. If validation fails we return the LLM's
rationale but flag the edit as `applied=False` so the frontend knows
not to push the broken SMILES into Ketcher.

_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a medicinal-chemistry assistant inside Liganx, \
a mutation-aware molecular-docking platform. The user is editing a small \
molecule in a 2D structure editor and wants help making a specific edit \
or improvement to it.

Behavior rules:
- Always return a SINGLE valid SMILES string for the proposed compound.
- The SMILES must parse with RDKit. Prefer canonical-style output.
- Keep edits minimal: change only what the user asked for, plus the \
unavoidable consequences of that change. Do not redesign the molecule.
- One short sentence of rationale: WHY this edit is reasonable, and ONE \
property delta (e.g. "logP +0.4, QED unchanged") if relevant.
- If the user gave a target context (PDB + mutation), prefer edits that \
are plausible for that pocket and mutation. Cite the residue or pocket \
feature briefly in the rationale.
- If the user's request is impossible, dangerous, or chemically meaningless \
(e.g. "swap H for Pb in every position"), say so in the rationale and \
return the ORIGINAL smiles unchanged.

Output format (STRICT — return ONLY this JSON, no preamble, no code fences):

"violates Lipinski rule of 5", "synthetically challenging", \
"reactive functional group" — any caveat the user should see."""
